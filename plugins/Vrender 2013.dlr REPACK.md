- If you do not want to use V-Ray, you can switch to a different render engine in 3ds Max, such as Scanline or Arnold. To do this, go to Rendering > Render Setup menu and select a different renderer from the drop-down list. Then, you will need to replace any V-Ray materials, lights or other components with ones that are compatible with your chosen renderer. You can use the Scene Converter tool in 3ds Max to help you with this process.
- If you want to use V-Ray, you will need to install the same version of V-Ray that was used to create or save the scene file. You can check the version number of V-Ray in the error message or in the scene file properties. You can download and install V-Ray from Chaos Group's website. If you already have a different version of V-Ray installed, you will need to uninstall it first using the Clean Uninstall tool provided by Chaos Group.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the missing vrender 2013.dlr error and load your scene file successfully in 3ds Max.
