If you are planning to conduct a clinical investigation of your medical device for regulatory purposes, you need to follow the requirements of ISO 14155 2011.pdf to ensure that:
  
- You protect the rights, safety and well-being of the human subjects
- You ensure the scientific conduct and credibility of the clinical investigation results
- You define the responsibilities of the sponsor and principal investigator
- You assist the ethics committees, regulatory authorities and other bodies involved in the conformity assessment of your medical device

ISO 14155 2011.pdf is based on the principles of the **Declaration of Helsinki**, which is a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects. It also harmonizes with other global guidelines, such as **ICH-GCP**, which is a guideline for good clinical practice issued by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.
  
ISO 14155 2011.pdf covers various aspects of clinical investigation, such as:

- Study design and planning
- Risk management
- Data management and quality control
- Monitoring and auditing
- Adverse event reporting and analysis
- Clinical investigation report writing and archiving

ISO 14155 2020 is an update and revision of ISO 14155 2011, which reflects the current state of the art and best practices in clinical investigation of medical devices. It also aligns with other relevant standards and regulations, such as ISO 14971 for risk management, ISO 13485 for quality management systems, and the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR).
  
Some of the main changes and additions in ISO 14155 2020 include:

- A new section on clinical performance and effectiveness, which clarifies the definitions and concepts of these terms and how they relate to safety
- A new section on software as a medical device (SaMD), which provides guidance on how to apply the standard to SaMD, considering their unique characteristics and risks
- A new section on risk-based monitoring, which describes how to plan and implement a monitoring strategy that is proportionate to the risk level of the clinical investigation
- A new section on electronic data systems and data protection, which covers the requirements for using electronic systems for data capture, management, storage and transfer, as well as the protection of personal data and privacy
- A new annex on guidance for ethics committees (ECs), which outlines the roles and responsibilities of ECs in reviewing and approving clinical investigations

ISO 14155 2020 also provides more details and examples on various topics, such as study design, risk management, data management, adverse event reporting, clinical investigation report writing, and archiving.
