# Manavalakalai Yoga: A Simplified Kundalini Yoga Practice by Vethathiri Maharishi
 
Manavalakalai Yoga is a system of yoga practices developed by Vethathiri Maharishi, a spiritual leader and visionary from Tamil Nadu, India. Manavalakalai means "the art of sublimating the mind" in Tamil, and it aims to achieve physical, mental and spiritual well-being through a series of exercises, meditations and introspections.
 
Manavalakalai Yoga is based on the principles of Simplified Kundalini Yoga (SKY), which was formulated by Maharishi to make the ancient science of kundalini yoga accessible to everyone. SKY involves awakening the dormant life force energy (kundalini) at the base of the spine and raising it to the crown of the head through a simple touch technique. This process is said to enhance one's health, intelligence, creativity and intuition.

Manavalakalai Yoga also includes other practices such as physical exercises, breathing techniques, eye exercises, relaxation methods, kayakalpa yoga (a rejuvenation technique), introspection techniques (such as self-analysis, moralization, neutralization and eradication of negative emotions), and simplified physical exercises (such as walking, jogging and cycling).
 
Manavalakalai Yoga is taught by the World Community Service Centre (WCSC), an organization founded by Maharishi in 1958 to spread his vision of world peace and harmony. WCSC has branches all over India and abroad, and offers courses, workshops, camps and publications on Manavalakalai Yoga and other aspects of Maharishi's philosophy.
 
One of the publications available from WCSC is a book titled "Manavalakalai Yoga" in Tamil, which contains a detailed explanation of the theory and practice of Manavalakalai Yoga. The book has 755 pages and can be downloaded as a PDF file from the WCSC website[^1^] or from other online sources[^2^]. The book is also available in English and other languages.
 
Manavalakalai Yoga is a holistic approach to personal development that can benefit anyone who wants to improve their physical, mental and spiritual health. By practicing Manavalakalai Yoga regularly, one can experience peace, happiness and harmony within oneself and with others.
  
Some of the benefits of Manavalakalai Yoga are:

- It can enhance one's happiness and joy by balancing the energy flow in the nadis (subtle channels) and chakras (energy centers) of the body. The practice of nadi yoga (nadhi yoga) can also help to overcome distractions, stress and negative emotions[^3^].
- It can improve one's immunity and vitality by stimulating the endocrine glands and rejuvenating the cells. The practice of kayakalpa yoga (kayakalpa yoga) can also help to delay aging, prevent diseases and increase lifespan[^1^].

Manavalakalai Yoga is not just a physical exercise, but a way of life that can transform one's consciousness and perception of reality. By practicing Manavalakalai Yoga regularly, one can attain a state of self-realization and bliss, which is the ultimate goal of yoga.
