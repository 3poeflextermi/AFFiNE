## Step 2: Connect your Windows PC to a large screen
 
You can connect your Windows PC to a large screen using a HDMI cable, a VGA cable, or a wireless adapter. Make sure that both devices are turned on and that the input source of the large screen is set to the correct one. You should see your Windows desktop on the large screen.
 
## Step 3: Launch MirrorOp Receiver and scan for senders
 
Once you have installed MirrorOp Receiver, you can launch it from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see a window with a QR code and a list of available senders. A sender is any device that can transmit video and audio signals to the receiver using MirrorOp technology. For example, you can use your smartphone, tablet, laptop, or Chromebook as a sender. To scan for senders, click on the refresh button at the top right corner of the window. You should see the names and IP addresses of the senders that are connected to the same network as your receiver.
 
## Step 4: Connect to a sender and start mirroring
 
To connect to a sender, you can either scan the QR code with your sender device or enter the IP address manually. Once you are connected, you will see a preview of the sender's screen on your receiver window. You can also control some settings such as resolution, quality, audio, and full screen mode. To start mirroring, click on the play button at the bottom right corner of the window. You should see the sender's screen on both your receiver window and the large screen.
 
## Step 5: Disconnect from a sender and exit MirrorOp Receiver
 
To disconnect from a sender, click on the stop button at the bottom right corner of the window. You will see a message asking you to confirm your action. Click on OK to disconnect. To exit MirrorOp Receiver, click on the X button at the top right corner of the window. You will see another message asking you to confirm your action. Click on OK to exit.
