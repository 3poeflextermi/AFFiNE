## A Comparison of Far Cry 5 Gold Edition with Other Far Cry Games
 
Far Cry 5 Gold Edition is the latest installment in the Far Cry series, which started in 2004 with the original Far Cry. The series is known for its exotic settings, open-world gameplay, and dynamic combat. Each game has a different protagonist, antagonist, and storyline, but they all share some common elements and themes.
 
One of the main differences between Far Cry 5 Gold Edition and the previous games is the setting. While the previous games took place in tropical islands, African savannas, Himalayan mountains, and prehistoric times, Far Cry 5 Gold Edition is set in modern-day America. This gives the game a more realistic and relatable feel, as well as a more diverse and detailed environment. The game also features more wildlife, vehicles, and weapons than the previous games.

Another difference is the narrative structure. While the previous games had a linear and scripted story, Far Cry 5 Gold Edition has a more flexible and emergent story. The game allows players to choose which region to explore first, and how to approach each mission. The game also has multiple endings, depending on the player's actions and choices. The game also features more side quests, activities, and collectibles than the previous games.
 
A third difference is the gameplay mechanics. While the previous games had a more stealth-oriented and tactical gameplay, Far Cry 5 Gold Edition has a more action-oriented and chaotic gameplay. The game encourages players to experiment with different weapons, vehicles, and explosives, and to use the environment to their advantage. The game also features a co-op mode that allows two players to play the entire campaign together. The game also has a map editor that allows players to create and share their own custom maps and modes.
 
Overall, Far Cry 5 Gold Edition is a worthy addition to the Far Cry series, and offers a lot of content and variety for gamers of all tastes and preferences. The game has received positive reviews from critics and players alike, and has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. The game is available on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Stadia.
