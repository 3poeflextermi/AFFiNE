The book also features a collection of well-designed and classroom-tested labs that provide clear guidance and practice of Android concepts. Each lab is geared toward one or two specific Android concepts, which eliminates distractions and gives the reader better focus on the concepts at hand. The labs also include step-by-step instructions, screenshots, code snippets, and exercises that reinforce learning and help students apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios.
 
Android Programming Concepts is an ideal textbook for introductory courses on Android app development, as well as a useful reference for experienced developers who want to update their skills or learn new features of the latest Android versions. The book is available in both ebook[^1^] and print formats[^2^], and can be downloaded from various online platforms[^3^]. Whether you are a student, a teacher, or a hobbyist, this book will help you master the fundamentals of Android programming and unleash your creativity.

To get started with Android app development, you will need to install Android Studio, the official IDE for Android. Android Studio provides a comprehensive and integrated environment that supports code editing, debugging, testing, and publishing. You can download Android Studio for free from the official website, and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. You will also need to install the Android SDK, which contains the libraries and tools that you need to build Android apps. You can install the SDK from within Android Studio, or download it separately from the SDK Manager.
 
Once you have installed Android Studio and the SDK, you can create your first Android project. Android Studio offers a variety of templates and wizards that help you set up your project structure and configuration. You can choose from different app categories, such as Basic Activity, Empty Activity, Navigation Drawer Activity, or Bottom Navigation Activity. You can also customize your app name, package name, minimum SDK version, and other options. After creating your project, you will see the main window of Android Studio, which consists of several panels and toolbars that allow you to access different features and functions.
 
The main components of an Android app are:

- Activities: An activity is a single screen that provides a user interface for a specific task or function. For example, an app might have an activity for logging in, another activity for viewing a list of items, and another activity for displaying the details of an item. Each activity has a corresponding Java class that defines its behavior and logic.
- Layouts: A layout is an XML file that defines the appearance and arrangement of the user interface elements on an activity. For example, a layout might contain text views, buttons, images, edit texts, and other widgets that display information or receive user input. You can create layouts using the Layout Editor in Android Studio, which provides a visual and a code editor for designing your UI.
- Resources: Resources are files that contain data or content that your app needs, such as strings, colors, images, sounds, fonts, etc. You can store resources in separate folders under the res directory of your project. For example, you can store strings in the values/strings.xml file, images in the drawable folder, and colors in the values/colors.xml file. You can reference resources in your code or layouts using the R class, which is automatically generated by Android Studio.
- Manifest: The manifest is an XML file that describes the essential information about your app to the Android system and the users. For example, the manifest declares the app name, icon, version, permissions, activities, services, broadcast receivers, content providers, and other components that your app uses. You can edit the manifest using the Manifest Editor in Android Studio.

These are some of the basic concepts and components that you need to know to develop Android apps. However, there is much more to learn and explore in the world of Android programming. That's why we recommend you to read Android Programming Concepts by Trish Cornez and Richard Cornez , which provides a comprehensive and practical guide for learning how to create amazing Android apps.
