# How to Download MDAC 2.1 for Windows 11
 
MDAC stands for Microsoft Data Access Components, a set of software components that enable applications to access data from various sources using ADO, OLE DB, and ODBC. MDAC 2.1 was released in 1999 and is compatible with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000.
 
However, if you are using Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft's operating system, you may encounter some issues when trying to install or run MDAC 2.1. This is because Windows 11 does not support MDAC 2.1 natively and requires a newer version of MDAC, such as MDAC 2.8.
