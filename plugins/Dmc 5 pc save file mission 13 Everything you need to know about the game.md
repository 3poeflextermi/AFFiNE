To complete mission 13 with an S rank, you need to achieve a high score by performing stylish combos, avoiding damage, and finishing the mission quickly. You also need to collect all the orbs, secret missions, and blue and purple fragments in the mission. Some of the tips for achieving an S rank are:

- Use Dante's Royal Guard style to parry Cavaliere Angelo's attacks and build up your Royal Gauge. Then unleash devastating attacks with Royal Release or use the Royal Revenge skill to counterattack.
- Use Nero's Devil Breakers to deal damage and stun Malphas. The Overture and Punch Line Devil Breakers are especially effective against her. You can also use Nero's Devil Trigger to heal yourself and boost your attack power.
- Use V's familiars to attack Urizen from a distance and avoid his projectiles. Keep an eye on your Devil Trigger gauge and use it to summon Nightmare when you have a chance. Nightmare can deal massive damage and distract Urizen from targeting you.

By downloading and installing the DMC 5 PC save file mission 13, you can skip the previous missions and jump right into the action. You can also enjoy playing as Vergil, who is a fan-favorite character and has his own unique moves and abilities. Vergil can use his Yamato sword, his Beowulf gauntlets and greaves, and his Mirage Edge sword to slash through enemies. He can also use his Concentration mechanic to increase his damage output and his Sin Devil Trigger mode to unleash his full potential.
