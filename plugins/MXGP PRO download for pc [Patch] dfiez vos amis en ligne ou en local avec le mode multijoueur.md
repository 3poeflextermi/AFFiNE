## How to Play MXGP PRO?
 
MXGP PRO is not an easy game to master, especially if you are new to motocross racing. You need to learn how to control your bike, how to deal with different terrains and weather conditions, how to perform tricks and stunts, and how to compete against other riders. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you improve your skills and win races in MXGP PRO:

- Choose the right difficulty level. MXGP PRO offers four difficulty levels: Standard, Semi-Pro, Pro and Realistic. Each level affects the bike's physics, the AI's behaviour, the assists and the penalties. If you are a beginner, you might want to start with Standard or Semi-Pro, which offer more stability and guidance. If you are an expert, you might want to challenge yourself with Pro or Realistic, which offer more realism and difficulty.
- Customize your bike. MXGP PRO allows you to adjust your bike's configuration like a mechanic, tuning the suspension, brakes or throttle to make your ride unique. You can also choose from different types of tyres, gears and engines. Each component affects the performance and handling of your bike, so you need to find the best balance for each track and condition.
- Practice in the Compound. The Compound is a vast area where you can freely explore or compete against the AI. You can practice up to 30 challenges to learn real riders' techniques, such as braking, cornering, jumping and scrubbing. You can also test your skills in different modes, such as Time Attack, Checkpoint Race and Head-to-Head Race.
- Use the Rewind feature. MXGP PRO has a Rewind feature that lets you rewind time and correct your mistakes. You can use this feature by pressing the Back button on your controller or the R key on your keyboard. However, you can only use this feature a limited number of times per race, depending on the difficulty level. Also, using this feature will reduce your final score and reputation points.
- Watch the tutorials and replays. MXGP PRO has a tutorial mode that teaches you the basics of the game, such as how to control your bike, how to use the assists and how to perform tricks. You can access this mode by selecting Tutorial from the main menu. You can also watch replays of your races or other riders' races by selecting Replay from the pause menu or the results screen. You can learn from your mistakes or from other riders' strategies by watching replays.
