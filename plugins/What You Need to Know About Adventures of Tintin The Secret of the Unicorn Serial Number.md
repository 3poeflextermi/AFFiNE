The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn game is based on the movie, which is in turn based on three of the original comic books: The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn, and Red Rackham's Treasure. The game follows the same plot as the movie, but also adds some original scenes and characters that are not in the movie.
  
The game is divided into several chapters, each with a different setting and gameplay style. For example, in one chapter, you have to pilot a plane and avoid enemy fire, while in another chapter, you have to sneak around a pirate ship and knock out guards. The game also features some mini-games and collectibles that you can unlock by exploring the environments and solving puzzles.

Some praised the game for its faithful adaptation of the comic book style and its variety of gameplay modes, while others criticized the game for its short length, technical issues, and lack of challenge. The game has also been compared to other adventure games like Uncharted and Tomb Raider.
