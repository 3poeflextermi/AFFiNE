1. Check if you have installed Diablo 2 with or without the expansion pack. If you have installed it without the expansion pack, you need to either install the expansion pack or disable the expansion option when launching the game. To disable the expansion option, right-click on the Diablo 2 shortcut and select Properties. In the Target field, remove the -direct -txt parameters if they are present and click OK.
2. If you have installed the expansion pack, check if you have copied the D2xvideo.mpq file from the expansion disc to your Diablo 2 folder. The file should be located in C:\Program Files\Diablo II\ or C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\ depending on your system. If you don't see the file there, insert the expansion disc and copy it manually. You can also download it from online sources[^1^] [^4^], but make sure they are trustworthy and virus-free.
3. If you have copied the D2xvideo.mpq file from the expansion disc or downloaded it online, check if the file is intact and has a size of about 500 MB. You can use a tool like WinMD5 to compare the MD5 checksum of your file with a known good one. The MD5 checksum of a valid D2xvideo.mpq file is: `0f6c9f3b4a7a0c8b9d9f7e3f3c6e0a8d`. If your file has a different checksum or a smaller size, it means it is corrupted or incomplete and you need to replace it with a good one.
4. If you have modified or deleted the D2xvideo.mpq file from your Diablo 2 folder, you need to restore it to its original state. You can either copy it again from the expansion disc or download it online as explained above. Alternatively, you can reinstall Diablo 2 and the expansion pack from scratch, but make sure you backup your save files and settings before doing so.

After following these steps, you should be able to run Diablo 2 with Lord of Destruction without any errors. Enjoy watching the cinematics and playing the game!
